				<h3>ART DIRECTION</h3>
				<p>
					At this stage, we define the overall look and style of the project. This includes selecting colors, textures, key
					aesthetic decisions, and creating a concept that will serve as the foundation for further work. The goal is to determine
					how the project will look as a whole.

				<h3>BLOCKING</h3>
				<p>
					During this stage, we develop the basic structure of the animation. We determine the movements and positions of objects
					on the scene, creating a motion plan. This helps us understand how objects will interact in the animation and the
					primary motion paths.

				<h3>ASSETING</h3>
				<p>
					At this stage, we create all the necessary resources for the animation, such as characters, objects, backgrounds, and
					other elements. Resources may be created in vector programs or modeled in 3D environments. This is a crucial stage
					because the quality of resources affects the appearance of the animation.

				<h3>LOOK DEVELOPMENT</h3>
				<p>
					During this stage, we give visual style to the assets. This includes texturing, lighting, material adjustments, and
					color correction. The goal is to make all resources vibrant, attractive, and in line with the art direction concept.

				</div>
				<h3>COMPOSITING</h3>
				<p>
					On the final stage, we combine all previous stages and create the final animation. We add special effects, adjust
					colors, fix errors, and add sound if necessary. The result is a finished motion design project ready for presentation to
					the client.
